ABSTRACT = {Optimal transport theory has recently found many applications in machine learning thanks to its capacity to meaningfully compare various machine learning objects that are viewed as distributions. The Kantorovitch formulation, leading to the Wasserstein distance, focuses on the features of the elements of the objects, but treats them independently, whereas the Gromov&ndash;Wasserstein distance focuses on the relations between the elements, depicting the structure of the object, yet discarding its features. In this paper, we study the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance that extends the Wasserstein and Gromov&ndash;Wasserstein distances in order to encode simultaneously both the feature and structure information. We provide the mathematical framework for this distance in the continuous setting, prove its metric and interpolation properties, and provide a concentration result for the convergence of finite samples. We also illustrate and interpret its use in various applications, where structured objects are involved.},

  abstract = "Multiplexed RNA sequencing in individual cells is transforming
              basic and clinical life sciences1-4. Often, however, tissues must
              first be dissociated, and crucial information about spatial
              relationships and communication between cells is thus lost.
              Existing approaches to reconstruct tissues assign spatial
              positions to each cell, independently of other cells, by using
              spatial patterns of expression of marker genes5,6-which often do
              not exist. Here we reconstruct spatial positions with little or
              no prior knowledge, by searching for spatial arrangements of
              sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional
              profiles that are often (but not always) more similar than cells
              that are farther apart. We formulate this task as a generalized
              optimal-transport problem for probabilistic embedding and derive
              an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. We reconstruct the
              spatial expression of genes in mammalian liver and intestinal
              epithelium, fly and zebrafish embryos, sections from the
              mammalian cerebellum and whole kidney, and use the reconstructed
              tissues to identify genes that are spatially informative. Thus,
              we identify an organization principle for the spatial expression
              of genes in animal tissues, which can be exploited to infer
              meaningful probabilities of spatial position for individual
              cells. Our framework ('novoSpaRc') can incorporate prior spatial
              information and is compatible with any single-cell technology.
              Additional principles that underlie the cartography of gene
              expression can be tested using our approach.",

              thousands of spots from a tissue slice while recording the
              two-dimensional (2D) coordinates of each spot. We introduce
              probabilistic alignment of ST experiments (PASTE), a method to
              align and integrate ST data from multiple adjacent tissue slices.
              PASTE computes pairwise alignments of slices using an optimal
              transport formulation that models both transcriptional similarity
              and physical distances between spots. PASTE further combines
              pairwise alignments to construct a stacked 3D alignment of a
              tissue. Alternatively, PASTE can integrate multiple ST slices
              into a single consensus slice. We show that PASTE accurately
              aligns spots across adjacent slices in both simulated and real ST
              data, demonstrating the advantages of using both transcriptional
              similarity and spatial information. We further show that the
              PASTE integrated slice improves the identification of cell types
